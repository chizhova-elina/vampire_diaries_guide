    <string name="theSalvatoreMansion">Despite a long list of passionate petitioners, the house formerly known as the Salvatore Boarding House was torn down in 2015. The 14,000 square foot mansion, also known as Glenridge Hall, was initially built in 1929 for Thomas K. Glenn and was later renovated by his granddaughter, Frances Mayson, and her husband Joseph. </string>
